# Event Management Application

## by Colby Sparks

The program I am building is an event management app, so essentially a to-do list with a few bells 
and whistles.  I used to do sound for a music/arts venue downtown and my friend Jo, the person who managed the space, 
was always talking about how terrible his booking system was.  He was licensing it from some small software developer,
but it was lacking basic features that would have made his job a lot easier.  

Some of the basic features he wanted were:
- to view **all** scheduled events in a calendar
- to be able to **edit events** from the calendar window
- the capacity to **store PDFs or JPEGs** with event info (riders and stage plots) and to view them from the calendar

People who manage venues and book shows are very few, so on top of the above functionality I would also like
to include simple features (which happen to be a subset of the features of an even-management app) so that users
can:
- **create simple events** with date/time/location and any additional information
- **view/select/edit** their stored events on a calendar
- view events according to **importance**

This would be an application that your average person could use, but also something that would hopefully be useful to
someone like Jo, who needs to keep track of many events with very detailed information.

This project is of personal interest to me because I used to work in the music industry, and I would like to actually
create a program that my friend might find useful.  I have bigger plans for more features that I'd like to implement,
but I don't want to get ahead of myself.  For now, I think the features described above will be useful enough on
their own.
