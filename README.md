# Event Management Application

## by cosparks

This event management app was built with concert promoters and venue managers in mind.  It allows the user to keep track
of costs and organization of a calendar full of events with different attributes: acts (bands, speakers, performers), employees, tickets and ticket price, bar and bar items etc..  A user can easily create and delete events, move events around and change any data associated with an event, then save their information to come back to later.  The software also estimates an event's potential profit based on a tabulation of costs and revenue.

The GUI was built using Java Swing, data permanence was implemented using Json, and the data model was built using test-driven development with JUnit 5.
